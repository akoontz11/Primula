## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and parameter files used for the genomic analysis of the __Primula cusickiana__ species complex. 
It is continuously being updated as the manuscript is in preparation. 

The `ipyrad` directory contains 4 folders, each corresponding to a unique run of the [ipyrad](https://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) software. Directories contain the relevant `params` files used for each run, as well as relevant outfiles (although not all output files are included, as this would require too much space).

The `structure` directory contains folders holding the `mainparams` and `extraparams` files for various STRUCTURE runs, as well as scripts used for these STRUCTURE runs and (occassionally) the .str (or .ustr) files themselves. Note that some of these STRUCTURE runs were exploratory, while others are referred to in our final analyses.

Finally, the `R` directory contains R scripts used for data analysis. This is currently a little disorganized, but directories are used to group scripts designed for similar purposes.
